# Clicky-Game

This is a React app. 

The application renders different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events.

The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the 
first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
